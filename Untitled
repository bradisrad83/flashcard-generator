//Psuedocode for week 11 homework
//create 10 trivia questions into an array/object
//    properties are front/back (for basic)
//    and text/cloze/partial (for clozecard)
//To see if it works we will display all questions
//    Both basic and clozecard
//    Create cards using constructors
//Using inquirer prompt for each question (switch for basic/clozecard----or if/else)
//Take user input to compare to the correct answer
//++ for correct
//At the end display the number of correct answers
//Log the results
